#' thermopic: Predicting and visualizing the seasonal available of thermal habitat in lakes
#' 
#' A ThermoPic is a picture of thermal habitat in a lake. This software serves
#' three purposes. First, it predicts the seasonal temperature cycle in lakes
#' based on easily measured variables. Second, it calculates and reports thermal
#' habitat statistics. Third, it generates a ThermoPic plot. The model used to 
#' predict temperature is referred to as the Seasonal Temperature Model (STM). 
#' It was created by Minns et al. (2016) based on data from lakes in the province 
#' of Ontario (Canada).
#' 
#' The thermopic package works with thermopic projects, which are filesystem directories
#' with a special structure
#' 
#' TODO: describe how to use the package with reference to the original pdf document
